# Saeed Mehrang's Personal Website

This repository hosts my personal website, built using Hugo and a [PaperMod modified template](https://github.com/pmichaillat/hugo-website).

**Please note:** This repository is maintained as my personal website and is not intended to be used directly as a template. If you are looking for the original Hugo PaperMod template, please refer to the official [PaperMod template](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) or [PaperMod modified template](https://github.com/pmichaillat/hugo-website) (that I am using) by Github user [@pmichaillat](https://github.com/pmichaillat).

I have made some customizations to the theme for my specific needs, including modifications to the main page layout, textual line breaks, and other configurations to suit my personal content and aesthetic preferences.

Feel free to explore the site and its content.
